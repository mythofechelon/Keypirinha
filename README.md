An [Inno Setup](https://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)-based installer for Keypirinha ([web site](http://keypirinha.com) / [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Keypirinha/Keypirinha)).

To compile your own installer:
1. Install Inno Setup from https://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php
2. Download a Keypirinha version from http://keypirinha.com/download.html and extract the `7Z` file to a folder. Your folder should simply contain the folder `Keypirinha`.

4. Alt-select / right-click on the `ISS` file and select `Compile`.
5. The resulting `EXE` file will be in a folder named `Output`.
